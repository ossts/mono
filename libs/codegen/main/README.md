# @ossts/codegen

Library for code generation with support for 3rd party generators (coming later).

This development of this package was inspired by awesome job done developers of this package [OpenAPI Typescript Codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen/), but it has limited capabilities on what can be generated. This package would allow writing custom generators based on parsed schema.
