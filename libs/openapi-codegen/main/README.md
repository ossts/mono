# @ossts/openapi-codegen

Library for OpenAPI code generation with support for 3rd party generators (comming later).

This development of this package was exprired by awesome job done developers of this package [OpenAPI Typescript Codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen/), but it has limited capabilities on what can be generated. This pacakge would allow writing custom generators based on parsed schema.
